# Gicha

**Your Python Infrawork. What is infrawork? It's like framework, but extended to the infrastructure running it!**

The Python framework is [Chalice](https://aws.github.io/chalice/). The infrastructure on which it runs is thus AWS.

Gicha enforces a specific way of operating Chalice from Github.
In fact, Gicha is short for **Gi**thub + **Cha**lice.
In particular, CI/CD Github actions are managed by Gicha.

## Usage

Create a new Gicha stack in minutes using the [Gicha CLI](https://github.com/hei-school/gicha-cli).
Update an existing Gicha stack in seconds using the same CLI!
